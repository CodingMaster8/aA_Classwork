DEPRECATION WARNING: Passing a class to the `class_name` is deprecated and will raise an ArgumentError in Rails 5.2. It eagerloads more classes than necessary and potentially creates circular dependencies. Please pass the class name as a string: `has_many :enrollments, class_name: 'Enrollment'` (called from <class:User> at /Users/jc/Desktop/aA_Classwork/W5D4/skeleton/app/models/user.rb:3)
